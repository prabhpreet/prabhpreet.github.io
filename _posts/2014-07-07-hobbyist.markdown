Well, now that my intention and aim is established, I believe it is my duty to do it the justice it deserves.

I am currently pursuing Electronics and Communication Engineering and hope to learn much more from it than just the standard theoretical angle. I've done a project on a PIC and an ATMEGA. Now, I'm doing another project on the ATMEGA. I'm also looking forward to get involved in ham radio. I hope to share what I've learned and how I've "applied myself".

Until next time, adios.
